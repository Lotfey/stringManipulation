The folder contains:

    results folder contains my results(sample.table.txt and sample.reverse.txt)    
    input file: sample.txt

    main.cpp file tests two classes 
    
    textOccurence.cpp file implements the the class textOccurence
    textOccurence.h is the  textOccurence class header
    
    textReverse.cpp file implements the class textReverse
    textReverse.h is the  textReverse class header
        
    Makefile compile and create an executable of the program

How to run the program:

    Clone this repo to your local working directory 
    install g++ compiler 
    set the command line directory to your working directory using (cd workingdirectory)  
    run: make
    you should create the executable "textManipulation"
    run: ./textManipulation sample.txt

outputs:

    .o files (objects files)
    sample.table.txt contains the word frequency of occurrence 
    sample.reverse.txt contains the revered text
